# The Raygun Traffic Light Company

We are a manufacturer of the worlds best traffic lights, but we have a few problems with our software and we need your help!

## Exercise 1
Our traffic light seems to always start on Yellow instead of Red. 

**Task**:
Find out why this is happening and fix it so that it starts on Red.


## Exercise 2
Our traffic light is fresh out the box.

**Task**:
Complete the cycleLightV1 function so that the traffic cycles colors in the following order:
Red -> Green -> Yellow -> Red


## Exercise 3
We want to add a feature to our traffic light.

**Task**: We want you to add a new button that, when clicked, will turn all of the lights white.
