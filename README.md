# The Raygun Traffic Light Company

We are a manufacturer of the worlds best traffic lights, but we have a few problems with our software and we need your help!

## Exercise 1
Our traffic light seems to always start on Yellow instead of Red. 

Task:
- Find out why this is happening and fix it so that it starts on Red.


## Exercise 2
Our traffic light is cycling colors in the wrong order.

Task:
- Update the traffic light so that it cycles colors in the right order: Red -> Green -> Yellow -> Red


## Exercise 3
We want to add a feature to our traffic light. We want you to add a new button that, when clicked, will turn all of the lights white.
